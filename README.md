# AirBnB clone - The console

![AirBnb Console](hbnb.png)

## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the `AirBnB clone`. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## How To Use It

### Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### But also in non-interactive mode:

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
